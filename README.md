SystemHeat
==========

A KSP mod implementing a simplistic framework for thermal mechanics. Includes several basic modules to manage heat.


*ModuleSystemHeat*

Basic SystemHeat component. Attach to all components involved in the heat system. Options for running continuous radiative and convective transfers simulations at a simplistic level. Will take into account things like incoming solar radiation, outgoing thermal radiation, atmospheric temperature, wind speeds and densities. 

*ModuleGenericRadiator*

Basic module for radiating heat anywhere. Currently supports static and deployable radiators. 

*ModuleGenericConvector*

Basic module for forced convective heat transfer in an atmosphere. Uses power to dissipate heat which scales depending on atmospheric properties.
