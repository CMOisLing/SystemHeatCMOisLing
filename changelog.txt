- Changed systemPower key in ModuleSystemHeatHarvester and ModuleSystemHeatConverter to a float
- Improved exception handling and debugging overall

v0.2.0
------
- Added Chinese localization (TerrestrisYE)
- Added additional converter patches, including NF Electrical, NF Propulsion, CryoTanks (TerrestrisYE)
- Halved the radiating capacity of all high temperature and microchannel radiators BUT halved their mass.
- Added some better handling for parts that have underscores in their part internal names
- Localized ModuleSystemHeatEngine
- Injected system heat parameters into PartInfo blocks for ModuleResourceConverter and ModuleResourceHarvester
- Worked on normalizing PartInfo blocks for System Heat modules in terminology and look and feel
- Increased the amount of coolant in the coolant tank part by 5x

v0.1.5
------
- Added manual control mode to Fission Reactors
- Added Heat Control wraparound radiators to radiator patch

- Fixed wrong target temperature for some radiators

v0.1.4
------
- Fixed Generation and Rejection values in the overlay being reversed
- Fixed Reactor control panel on/off toggle firing events when on/off toggle in the PAW was fired
- Localized ModuleSystemHeatHarvester and ModuleSystemHeatConverter

v0.1.3
------
- Worked on localization of things not previously localized (reactor panel, toolbar panel, ModuleHeatSink)
- Added a UI button to charge fusion reactors in the reactor panel
- Reactor/Heat toolbar buttons should now hide when looking at a vessel without reactors or heat modules
- More random bugfixes

v0.1.1
------
- Fixed issue with map vector camera not being reset when entering map view (messing up orbit lines)
- Fixed some issues with ModuleSystemHeatEngine contributing to loop max temperatures despite being off
- Fixed global thermal scaling being set to 0.025x what was intended, causing UI confusion 
- Fixed some cases of NREs where parts were destroyed
- Tweaked behaviour of radiators to allow cooling when nominal temperatures are low but actual temperatures are high
- Thermal summary in toolbar window now turns orange when a value is bad
- Turned off PAW debug by default

v0.1.0
------
