v0.3.3
------
- Fixed fission reactors still generating power/working when they were full of waste
- Fixed fission reactors that didn't generate electricity not generating waste
- Added Hibernate On Warp control to fission reactors: if activated, an enabled reactor will turn off when the ship goes on rails. It will reactivate when the ship goes off rails. 
- Fixed a bug in loop integration that could cause strange behaviour below norminal temperatures

v0.3.2
------
- Heat Control radiator names are now adjusted when installed to match their SystemHeat capacities
- Couple of UI text fixes
- Fixed Heat Exchanger PartInfo being blank
- Fixed a couple of harmless but annoying NREs

v0.3.1
------
- Adjusted radiator masses (some errors before)
- Tweaks to the Refuel system
- Fixes to the Fission Engine patches

v0.3.0
------
- Pushed to KSP 1.11
- Improved Repair feature for fission reactors: now requires EVA repair kits. More kits needed for larger reactors
- Improved Refuel feature for fission reactors: now needs Kerbals to equip the Nuclear Fuel Container EVA part, and for them to collect fuel from containers to store in reactors
- Added Nuclear fuel container cargo part for working with fission engines/reactors

v0.2.3
------
- Updates to Chinese localization (TerrestrisYE)
- Fixed a number of changes from last update not actually being included :|
- Added generic harvester, converter patches from toric5
- Normalized drill thermal efficiencies
- Hid heat sink part. 

v0.2.2
------
- Corrected NFE Nuclear Recycler Uranium Extractor patch not working
- Fixed production ratios not working correctly overall
- Changed systemPower key in ModuleSystemHeatHarvester and ModuleSystemHeatConverter to a float
- Improved exception handling and debugging overall

v0.2.0
------
- Added Chinese localization (TerrestrisYE)
- Added additional converter patches, including NF Electrical, NF Propulsion, CryoTanks (TerrestrisYE)
- Halved the radiating capacity of all high temperature and microchannel radiators BUT halved their mass.
- Added some better handling for parts that have underscores in their part internal names
- Localized ModuleSystemHeatEngine
- Injected system heat parameters into PartInfo blocks for ModuleResourceConverter and ModuleResourceHarvester
- Worked on normalizing PartInfo blocks for System Heat modules in terminology and look and feel
- Increased the amount of coolant in the coolant tank part by 5x

v0.1.5
------
- Added manual control mode to Fission Reactors
- Added Heat Control wraparound radiators to radiator patch
- Added some background improvements to Converter and Harvester adapter modules
- Fixed wrong target temperature for some radiators

v0.1.4
------
- Fixed Generation and Rejection values in the overlay being reversed
- Fixed Reactor control panel on/off toggle firing events when on/off toggle in the PAW was fired
- Localized ModuleSystemHeatHarvester and ModuleSystemHeatConverter

v0.1.3
------
- Worked on localization of things not previously localized (reactor panel, toolbar panel, ModuleHeatSink)
- Added a UI button to charge fusion reactors in the reactor panel
- Reactor/Heat toolbar buttons should now hide when looking at a vessel without reactors or heat modules
- More random bugfixes

v0.1.1
------
- Fixed issue with map vector camera not being reset when entering map view (messing up orbit lines)
- Fixed some issues with ModuleSystemHeatEngine contributing to loop max temperatures despite being off
- Fixed global thermal scaling being set to 0.025x what was intended, causing UI confusion 
- Fixed some cases of NREs where parts were destroyed
- Tweaked behaviour of radiators to allow cooling when nominal temperatures are low but actual temperatures are high
- Thermal summary in toolbar window now turns orange when a value is bad
- Turned off PAW debug by default

v0.1.0
------
- Initial version controlled release
-
